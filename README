This batch file automate the process of fetching GIT/SVN source, updating SQL database and building the different
 components of a Mangos server such as :Mangos, ScriptDev2 and ACID.

What the user have to do:
-Edit the configuration section of the file "sql_update.bat" with user information’s.
 (SQL log-in, DB names and folders location)

Recommend directory hierarchy:
-Inside a folder, have the fallowing: Mangos source, your server directory, ACID folder and the sql_update.bat.

Configuration section cheat list:
# All defaults values are set for a standard installed of Mangos with VS2010 on a x64 system.
-sql_user   = Your SQL server account name
-sql_pass   = Your SQL server password
-mangos_db  = The name of you world database
-char_db    = The name of you characters database
-realmd_db  = The name of your realmd database
-sd2_db     = The name of your ScriptDev2 database
-mangos_dir = The path to your mangos source directory
-sd2dir     = The path to your ScriptDev2 source directory
-acid_dir   = The path to your ACID source directory
-acid_branch= witch acid branch you want to follow, ex: classic, tbc, wotlk
-server_dir = The path to your Mangos server directory
-bin        = Set this to which architecture you want to build Mangos and ScriptDev2, ex: x64, x32
-vsversion  = Set this the version of VStudio you are using, ex:vc80, vc90, vc100
#The script try to guess proper setting for the fallowing:
-msbuild    = This part try to guess the location of msbuild.exe. Adapt to your need if needed.
-gitdir     = This part try to guess the location of the git path. Adapt to your need if needed.
 
What the script does:
-Pull from Mangos GIT repository.
-Update SD2 and ACID SVN repository.
-Generate a file named sql_update.sql with the user DB information’s.
-Query the generated SQL file to get user DB versions.
-Output to screen current DB version.
-Scan Mangos SQL directory against DB versions and apply needed patch.
-Scriptdev2 and ACID SQL patch are then applied.
-Output to screen the new version in DB.
-Start to build Mangos and SD2.
-Copy the new *.exe and *.dll to the server folder.

What it doesn’t do:
-Fetch and apply update for custom world DB like; UDB, YTDB, PSMDB & etc.

TO DO list:
-Clean/simplified/remove static name as much as possible.
-Make it to more flexible.
-Rewrite the README so it can be read in a less chaotic way.
-And of course fix weird 'features' that user will find.

Dependency(Or recommended setup):
GIT client :
- Any Windows based GIT client should do, I use msysgit from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
 SVN client :
- Any CLI SVN client should do, I use SlikSVN from http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download
- I don't support ToirtoiseSVN, I know some people like to use it(including me) but it doesn't have proper
 CLI support and it was a mess to automate with all the GUI pop-up. Still, you can install it and use it in
 parallel with the CLI SVN client of your choice ... it's what I do.

-This script was made by me, akum(Simon Monette), using notepad++(mostly for the fancy bash color).
